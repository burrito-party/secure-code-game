You now know that bash.js uses regex to check for ".." in commands.
But the validator only sees the RAW TEXT of the command — it has no
idea what the command will actually do when bash runs it.

Think about this: what if the path "../password.txt" never appears
literally in your command, but bash reconstructs it at runtime?

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
If the above isn't enough to get you there, here's a more
concrete direction to explore:
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Look at the path traversal regex again:
  /(?:^|\s|\/)\.\.(\/|$|\s)/

It matches ".." when preceded by: start of line, whitespace, or "/"
It matches ".." when followed by: "/", end of line, or whitespace

But what about other characters before ".."? The regex only checks
for a specific set. What if ".." appeared after a character that
isn't in that set?

Think about how bash assigns variables:
  MYVAR=somevalue

What character comes right before the value in an assignment?

Now ask yourself:
  → Would the regex catch ".." if it appeared in a variable assignment?
  → If not, could you store ".." in a variable and use it later?
  → How does bash expand variables like $MYVAR in a command?

Remember: bash lets you chain commands with "&&" to run multiple
things in sequence on the same line.
