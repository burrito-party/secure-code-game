The websites in web/ are just HTML files. You can edit them.

Think about how a real attacker might hide instructions inside
a legitimate-looking webpage. What parts of HTML are invisible
to a human reader viewing the page in a browser, but would
still be read by an AI processing the raw HTML?

Consider: HTML comments, hidden elements, or text styled to
be invisible (zero font size, same colour as background).

---------------------------------------------------------------

If the above is not enough, here is another approach:

Instead of editing an existing website, you could also create
a brand new HTML file in the web/ directory. Make it about a
topic that would match a question you plan to ask ProdBot --
so that ProdBot's search picks it up and reads it.
