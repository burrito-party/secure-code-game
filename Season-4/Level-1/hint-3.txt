If the previous hint didn't work for you, here's a completely
different approach that uses encoding instead.

Consider how data can be ENCODED in one form and DECODED at runtime:

  → What does the Linux command `base64` do?
  → What happens if you encode a path with `echo "../password.txt" | base64`?
  → Could you give ProdBot a command that decodes a string and uses
    the result as a file path?

The validator doesn't know what base64 output looks like.
It only checks the input text for patterns it recognises.

Useful commands to experiment with (outside ProdBot):
  echo "../password.txt" | base64          # encode a path
  echo "Li4vcGFzc3dvcmQudHh0" | base64 -d # decode it back
