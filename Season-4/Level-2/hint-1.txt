ProdBot has a new feature: it can search the web.

When ProdBot visits a website, it reads the full HTML content
and sends it to the AI for processing. Think about that for a
moment -- ProdBot trusts everything it reads on the internet.

What if the website contained instructions that ProdBot's AI
would follow?

Start by looking at the websites in the web/ directory. Open
a few of them and read the HTML source code. Notice anything
about how they are structured?

Now think: who controls those websites?
