ProdBot has three MCP tool integrations. They all claim to
operate within the sandbox.

Type "tools" to see what is installed. Type "tool <name>" to
inspect a specific tool. Pay attention to what each tool
CLAIMS it can do vs. what it ACTUALLY does.

The source code for each MCP server is visible. Can you find
the source files and read them?

Tip: Use "tool <name>" — each tool shows a "Source" path. Ask
ProdBot to show you the file, or read it directly.
