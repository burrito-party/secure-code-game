|  Hint 2 -- TTL and Persistence           |
+------------------------------------------+

System memory entries have a TTL (time-to-live) that
controls how long they persist. After each command,
TTLs are decremented and expired entries are removed.

But what happens when a TTL is set to 0? Compare
how different skills write their system entries.
One skill's entry doesn't expire like the others.
