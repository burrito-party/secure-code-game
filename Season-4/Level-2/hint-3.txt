You need to combine two ideas:

1. Hiding instructions inside HTML that the AI will follow
2. Using a command that bypasses the validator (from Level 1)

The AI reads the full HTML of a website. If you put instructions
inside an HTML comment or a hidden element, the AI may treat
them as real instructions and generate the commands you asked
for — instead of just summarising the page.

But remember: the command validator is still active. You need
to use one of the techniques from Level 1 to construct a
command that passes validation but still reaches the file.

---------------------------------------------------------------

If the AI is just summarising the page as normal instead of
running your hidden command, think about the format ProdBot
uses to communicate — JSON responses with a specific structure.

The AI needs to know to respond with a command (not a text
message). Try including the expected response format in your
hidden instruction.
