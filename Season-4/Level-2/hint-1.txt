ProdBot has a new feature: it can search the web.

When ProdBot visits a website, it reads the full HTML content
and sends it to the AI for processing. Think about that for a
moment -- ProdBot trusts everything it reads on the internet.

What if the website contained instructions that ProdBot's AI
would follow?

Start by looking at the websites in the web/ directory. Open
a few of them and read the HTML source code. Notice anything
about how they are structured?

To preview any website in your browser, use ProdBot's web
search first (e.g., "what's the weather?"), then type:

    sources       - see which pages were found
    open 1        - open a source in the browser

Or serve them all manually:

    python3 -m http.server 8000 -d Season-4/Level-2/web

Then visit http://localhost:8000 in your browser.

Now think: who controls those websites?
