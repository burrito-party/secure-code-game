|  Hint 3 -- Scope and the Validator       |
+------------------------------------------+

The @onboarding skill writes a system entry with
scope=workspace and ttl=0. Unlike other skills'
entries (which expire after 1 command), this one
persists indefinitely.

The validator on this level checks for a system
entry with scope=workspace. When present, it
relaxes the path traversal restriction.

After running "onboarding", try:
  cat ../password.txt
