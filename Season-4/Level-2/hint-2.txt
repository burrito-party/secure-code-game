The websites in web/ are just HTML files simulating the public
internet. You can edit them OR create your own website, as per
the real world.

Think about how a real attacker might hide instructions inside
a legitimate-looking webpage. What parts of HTML are invisible
to a human reader viewing the page in a browser, but would
still be read by an AI processing the raw HTML?

Consider: HTML comments, hidden elements, or text styled to
be invisible (zero font size, same colour as background).

To see what a website looks like vs. its raw HTML, try:

    open 1        - view the page in the browser (after a search)

Then open the same file in your editor to see the raw source.
The difference between what humans see and what AI reads is
the key to this level.

---------------------------------------------------------------

If the above is not enough, here is another approach:

Instead of editing an existing website, you could also create
a brand new HTML file in the web/ directory. Make it about a
topic that would match a question you plan to ask ProdBot --
so that ProdBot's search picks it up and reads it.
