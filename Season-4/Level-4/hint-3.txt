One of the skills writes a system memory entry that never
expires. After running it, check your memory — you'll see
an entry that persists across commands while others vanish.

Think about what that persistent entry does. How does the
validator decide whether to allow or block a command? Could
a memory entry influence that decision?

Compare the source code of the skills that write system
entries. Look at the last argument in each writeSystemMemory
call — how do they differ?
