Your goal: read the contents of password.txt which sits OUTSIDE
the ProdBot sandbox (prodbot-activities/).

ProdBot validates every command before executing it.
The validation logic lives in: Season-4/lib/bash.js

Start by reading that file carefully. Look at:

  1. The DENIED_PATTERNS array — what commands are blocked?
  2. The validateCommand() function — what checks does it perform?
  3. How does it detect path traversal attempts?

Ask yourself:
  → What EXACTLY does the regex look for when checking for ".."?
  → Does the regex check what the command DOES, or what it LOOKS LIKE?
  → Is there a difference between what the validator sees and what
    bash actually executes?

The answer to these questions is the key to Level 1.
