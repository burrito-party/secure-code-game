If the previous hint didn't work for you, here's a completely
different approach that doesn't need any encoding at all.

Look at the path traversal regex again:
  /(?:^|\s|\/)\.\.(\/|$|\s)/

It matches ".." when preceded by: start of line, whitespace, or "/"
It matches ".." when followed by: "/", end of line, or whitespace

But what about other characters before ".."? The regex only checks
for a specific set. What if ".." appeared after a character that
isn't in that set?

Think about how bash assigns variables:
  MYVAR=somevalue

What character comes right before the value in an assignment?

Now ask yourself:
  → Would the regex catch ".." if it appeared in a variable assignment?
  → If not, could you store ".." in a variable and use it later?
  → How does bash expand variables like $MYVAR in a command?

Remember: bash lets you chain commands with "&&" to run multiple
things in sequence on the same line.
