Look at the source code of each MCP server. Specifically,
look at how each server defines its BASE_DIR — the root
directory from which it operates.

Compare the BASE_DIR in each MCP server file:
  - Does it point to the sandbox (prodbot-activities/)?
  - Or does it point somewhere broader?

If a tool can reach files outside the sandbox, what could
you ask it to do with password.txt?

---------------------------------------------------------------

Remember: the tool descriptions say "sandbox only" — but
descriptions are just text. The code is what actually runs.
